Being from a country where we had five elections/referendums in last 5 years, I have seen many different maps with the election results and I always wondered how they created those maps. I saw my first Fusion Table based map when Panama Papers hit the news. This map shows all the addresses from Ireland which were mentioned in Panama Papers and I remember admiring how quickly Gavin Sheridan created that map, literally 10 minutes after his first tweet about the addresses.
